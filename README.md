I am dr. Anna Latour, and I recently joined the [Algorithms group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/algorithmics) of the Computer Science department at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, as an assistant professor. For more info, it's probably best to check out [my website](https://latower.github.io).
